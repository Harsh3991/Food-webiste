        <p> Hello!And welcome to the Deliciosos Platos. My name is Harshwardhan, but you can call me "Hoyt." I am thrilled that you'll be joining our team. Each and every day, we serve our customers exceptional food with impeccable service. We take pride in everything that we do.<br>
            In the little village where I was born, life moved at a slower pace, yet I felt all the richer for it. There, my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking. They seasoned their zesty chicken using only the freshest herbs and spices. People called them "los Platos hermanos" ("The Supper Brothers"). Today, we carry on their tradition in a way that would make my uncles proud. The finest ingredients are brought together with love and care, then slow-cooked to perfection. Yes, the old ways are still best at Deliciosos Platos. But don't take my word for it. One taste, and you'll know.</p>
